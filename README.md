# OpenMonero - a fully open sourced implementation of MyMonero backend

In this example [restbed](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/) is used to
demonstrate how to provide Monero related JSON REST service. For this purpose,
 a service called Open Monero was developed.


OpenMonero is an open source implementation of backend of
https://mymonero.com/. The frontend, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, was adapted
from (and originally developed by) https://mymonero.com/.

Open Monero's backend is open sourced, free
to use, host and modify. Additionally, some features were added/changed as compared
to MyMonero. They include:

 - google analytics, cloudflare, images and flash were removed.
 - frontend's html and javascript upgrades and cleanups.
 - transaction service fee was set to zero (same as in MyMonero).
 - the wallets generated use 25 word mnemonics, fully compatible with official monero wallets
(13 word mnemonics generated by MyMonero work as usual though).
 - import wallet fee was reduced (can be set to 0).
 - added support of testnet and stagenet networks, and mainnet without relying transactions
 - improved handling of mempool, coinbase, locked and unlocked transactions.
 - view only mode added.
 - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) disabled.
 - ability to select transaction priority.
 - legacy address + payment_id system replaced with integrated addresses for better privacy.
 - free, time based imports of recent transactions added.

## Live stagenet version

- [http://139.162.60.17:81](http://139.162.60.17:81) - down for now.
- [http://139.162.60.17:8100](http://139.162.60.17:8100) - MyMonero frontend - down for now.

This is OpenMonero running on stagnet network. You can use it to play around with it.
Please note that the live version is running on cheap VPS, which may result in
performance issues.


## Current development version

All current changes, bug fixes and updates are done in the
[branch](https://github.com/moneroexamples/openmonero/tree/devel).

## Host it yourself

The Open Monero consists of four components that need to be setup for it to work:

 - MySql/Mariadb database - it stores user address (viewkey is not stored!),
 associated transactions, outputs, inputs and transaction import payments information.
 - Frontend - it is virtually same as that of MyMonero, except before mentioned differences.
  It consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 - Monero daemon - daemon must be running and fully sync, as this is
 where all transaction data is fetched from and used. Daemon also commits txs
 from the Open Monero into the Monero network.
 - Backend - fully written in C++. It uses [restbed](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/) to serve JSON REST to the frontend
 and [mysql++](http://www.tangentsoft.net/mysql++/) to interface the database. It also accesses Monero blockchain and "talks"
 with Monero deamon.


## Limitations

#### Performance

Open Monero is not as fast as MyMonero.
 This is because it is basic, easy to understand and
 straight forward implementation of the backend. Thus,
 it does not use any special memory buffers/caches for transactions,
 blocks, complex database structures and SQL queries. Also, no ongoing monitoring of user's
  transactions is happening, since user's viewkey is not stored (only its hash). Transaction search threads start when
  user logs in (viewkey and address are submitted to the search thread), and finish shorty
  after logout. Once the search threads stop, they can't be restarted without user logging
   in back, because viewkey is unknown.


## Example compilation on Ubuntu 18.04

Below are example and basic instructions on how to setup up and run Open Monero on Ubuntu 16.04.
For other Linux operating systems, the instructions are analogical.


#### Monero download and compilation

To download and compile recent Monero follow instructions
in the following link:

https://github.com/moneroexamples/monero-compilation/blob/master/README.md

#### Compilation of the OpenMonero (don't run it yet)

Once Monero was downloaded and compiled, we can download Open Monero and compile it.
In fact we could postpone compilation to later, but
we can just do it now, to see if it compiles. But don't run it yet. It will not
work without database, setup frontend, and synced and running monero blockchain.

```bash
# need mysql++ library
sudo apt install libmysql++-dev


# go to home folder if still in ~/monero
cd ~

# download the source code of the devel branch
git clone --recursive https://github.com/moneroexamples/openmonero.git

cd openmonero

mkdir build && cd build

cmake ..

# altearnatively can use cmake -DMONERO_DIR=/path/to/monero_folder ..
# if monero is not in ~/monero

make
```

#### MariaDB/MySQL (using docker)

The easiest way to setup MariaDB is through [docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) (assuming that you have docker setup and running)

Create mariadb container called `ommariadb` and root password of `root` (change these  how you want).

```
docker run --name ommariadb -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d mariadb
```

Create openmonero database called `openmonero`.

```
cd openmonero/sql
docker exec -i ommariadb mysql -uroot -proot < openmonero.sql
```

#### PhpMyAdmin (using docker)
A good way to manage/view the openmonero database is through the
[PhpMyAdmin in docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/). Using docker,
this can be done:

```
docker run --name myadmin -d --link ommariadb:db -p 8080:80 phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
```

where `ommariadb` is the name of docker container with mariadb, set in previous step.

With this, phpmyadmin should be avaliable at http://127.0.0.1:8080.


#### Nginx (using docker)

The fastest way to start up and server the frontend is through
[nginx docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/).

```
docker run --name omhtml -p 80:80 -v /home/mwo/openmonero/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx
```

where `omhtml` is docker container name, `80:80` will expose the frontend
on port 80 of the localhost, and `/home/mwo/openmonero/html` is the location on your host computer where the
frontend files are stored. All these can be changed to suit your requirements.

Go to localhost (http://127.0.0.1) and check if frontend is working.

#### mymonero-core-js (optional)

OpenMonero uses frontend code provided by mymonero.com. Among many files
used, the two crtical ones are binary webassamply
[MyMoneroCoreCpp_WASM.wasm](https://mymonero.com/js/lib/mymonero_core_js/monero_utils/MyMoneroCoreCpp_WASM.wasm) and
the corresponding JavaScript [mymonero-core.js](https://mymonero.com/js/lib/mymonero-core.js) files.
They are used by [send_coins.js](https://mymonero.com/js/controllers/send_coins.js?) for providing
transaction generation functionality.

OpenMonero provides these files here: `./html/js/lib`. They were generated using forked  `mymonero-core-js` repo:
https://github.com/moneroexamples/mymonero-core-js/tree/openmonero

However, you can compile them yourself using the orginal repository located at
https://github.com/mymonero/mymonero-core-js.

Below are instructions on how it can be done on Arch Linux.

```
git clone https://github.com/mymonero/mymonero-core-js.git

cd mymonero-core-js/

./bin/update_submodules

npm install

# download boost
wget -c "https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.68.0/source/boost_1_68_0.tar.gz" -O /tmp/boost.tar.gz && mkdir -p ./contrib && tar xzvf /tmp/boost.tar.gz -C ./contrib && mv ./contrib/boost_1_68_0/ ./contrib/boost-sdk

# set EMSCRIPTEN paths (for this, you need to have EMSCRIPTEN setup, e.g. in your home folder)
# http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

# compile boost
./bin/build-boost-emscripten.sh

# compile mymonero-core-js
./bin/build-emcpp.sh

# generate mymonero-core.js and MyMoneroCoreCpp_WASM.wasm 
./bin/package_browser_js

```

The above instructions should produce `mymonero-core.js`
and `mymonero_core_js/monero_utils/MyMoneroCoreCpp_WASM.wasm`
(both located in `./build` folder), which can
be used in place the files bundled with OpenMonero.


#### Run OpenMonero

Command line options

```bash
./openmonero -h
openmonero, Open Monero backend service:
  -h [ --help ] [=arg(=1)] (=0)         produce help message
  -t [ --testnet ] [=arg(=1)] (=0)      use testnet blockchain
  -s [ --stagenet ] [=arg(=1)] (=0)     use stagenet blockchain
  --do-not-relay [=arg(=1)] (=0)        does not relay txs to other nodes. 
                                        useful when testing construction and 
                                        submiting txs
  -p [ --port ] arg (=1984)             default port for restbed service of 
                                        Open Monero
  -c [ --config-file ] arg (=./config/config.json)
                                        Config file path.
  -m [ --monero-log-level ] arg (=1)    Monero log level 1-4, default is 1.
  -l [ --log-file ] arg (=./openmonero.log)
                                        Name and path to log file. -l "" to 
                                        disable log file.
```

Other backend options are in `confing/config.json`.

Before running `openmonero`:

 - edit `config/config.js` file with your settings. Especially set `frontend-url` and `database`
 connection details.
 - set `apiUrl` in `html\js\config.js` and `nettype` option. Last slash `/` in `apiUrl` is important.
 If running backend for testnet or stagenet networks, frontend `nettype` must be set to  
 1 - TESTNET or 2 - STAGENET. 0 is for MAINNET.
 - make sure monero daemon is running and fully sync. If using testnet or stagenet networks, use monero daemon
 with `--testnet` or `--stagenet` flags!


To start for mainnet:
```bash
./openmonero
```

To start for testnet:
```bash
./openmonero -t
```

To start for stagenet:
```bash
./openmonero -s
```

To start for stagenet with non-default location of `config.json` file:

```bash
./openmonero -s -c /path/to/config.json
```


## OpenMonero JSON REST API

Example JSON REST requests and their responses of [OpenMonero](https://github.com/moneroexamples/openmonero) are provided below. The long term goal
is to make the api conform to [jsent](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend)
specification which describs successful, failed and error responses. At present,
the OpenMonero api does not fully conform to that.

#### get_version

Get version of the OpenMonero, its API and monero.

```bash
curl  -w "\n" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1984/get_version
```
Example output:

```json
{
  "api": 65536,
  "blockchain_height": 965507,
  "git_branch_name": "upgrade_angularjs",
  "last_git_commit_date": "2017-07-25",
  "last_git_commit_hash": "456f9d6",
  "monero_version_full": "0.10.3.1-125f823"
}
```


`api` number is represented as `uint32_t`. In this case, `65536` represents
major version 1 and minor version 0.
In JavaScript, to get these numbers, one can do as follows:

```javascript
var api_major = response.data.api >> 16;
var api_minor = response.data.api & 0xffff;
```


### login

Login an existing or a new user into OpenMonero.

```bash
curl  -w "\n" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1984/login -d '{"address": "A2VTvE8bC9APsWFn3mQzgW8Xfcy2SP2CRUArD6ZtthNaWDuuvyhtBcZ8WDuYMRt1HhcnNQvpXVUavEiZ9waTbyBhP6RM8TV", "view_key": "041a241325326f9d86519b714a9b7f78b29111551757eeb6334d39c21f8b7400", "create_account": true, "generated_locally": true}'
```

Example output:
```json
{"generated_locally":false,"new_address":true,"start_height":0,"status":"success"}
```

### ping 

Pings a search thread for a given account to extend its life.

```bash
curl  -w "\n" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1984/ping -d '{"address": "A2VTvE8bC9APsWFn3mQzgW8Xfcy2SP2CRUArD6ZtthNaWDuuvyhtBcZ8WDuYMRt1HhcnNQvpXVUavEiZ9waTbyBhP6RM8TV", "view_key": "041a241325326f9d86519b714a9b7f78b29111551757eeb6334d39c21f8b7400"}'
```

Example output:
```json
{"generated_locally":false,"new_address":true,"start_height":0,"status":"success"}
```
#### get_address_txs

Get the list of all txs for the given user with their possible spendings.

```bash
curl  -w "\n" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1984/get_address_txs -d '{"address": "A2VTvE8bC9APsWFn3mQzgW8Xfcy2SP2CRUArD6ZtthNaWDuuvyhtBcZ8WDuYMRt1HhcnNQvpXVUavEiZ9waTbyBhP6RM8TV", "view_key": "041a241325326f9d86519b714a9b7f78b29111551757eeb6334d39c21f8b7400"}'
