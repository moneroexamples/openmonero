/*
 * This class takes user address, viewkey
 * and searches for outputs in a given tx
 * and possible spendings/inputs.
 *
 * It is the key class for identification of incoming monero
 * and candidate outcoming xmr for a user in a blockchain and in
 * mempool.
 *
 * searching for our incoming and outgoing xmr has two components.
 *
 * FIRST. to search for the incoming xmr, we use address, viewkey and
 * outputs public key. Its straight forward, as this is what viewkey was
 * designed to do.
 *
 * SECOND. Searching for spendings (i.e., key images) is more difficult,
 * because we dont have spendkey. But what we can do is, we can look for
 * candidate key images. And this can be achieved by checking if any mixin
 * in associated with the given key image, is our output. If it is our output,
 * then we assume its our key image (i.e. we spend this output). Off course this is only
 * assumption as our outputs can be used in key images of others for their
 * mixin purposes. Thus, we sent to the frontend the list of key images
 * that we think are yours, and the frontend, because it has spendkey,
 * can filter out false positives.
